    <p>Hello! I am Margaretta Angela Manullang. I am a student in the Informatics Engineering Study Program from the Sumatra Institute of Technology. When I was studying at SMAN 1 Tangerang Regency majoring in Mathematics and Natural Sciences, I liked making animations with the Corel Draw app, and usually I designed using Canva. I once took part in a national-based digital poster design competition, even though I didn't win, I really felt the benefits, like I became more knowledgeable about placing logos on a poster, there are no provisions for that, but it's good that the logos are not separated from each other, and made one in one. right corner or middle of the poster, and there are many more that I get when I take part in competitions or organizations that are fundamental to design. Even when I was in junior high school, I was starting to get to know design and participated in several organizations, but at that time I didn't have the courage to take part in competitions because of my lack of self-confidence, at that time I was only deepening my skills in public speaking. And in my current studies I am taking a design-based committee, with the aim of me honing my skills further.</p>
